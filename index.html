      <h1>Hello Jits</h1>
        <p>My name is Arsene and im a Grade 10 Student at Immaculata highschool</p>
      <h3>My favourite Passtime:Playing Sports </h3>
        <p>
          I love playing sports like volleyball and soccer with my friends.
          I play on a club team after school to improve my skills to further pursue my sport.

      <h5>My Least Favourite Subject:Math</h5>
        <p>
          Mathematics is one of my least favorite subjects. 
          I find math to often be boring and generally not as fun as other subjects.
          I would much rather do English.
